// The internal buffer in the context of fs.createReadStream() in Node.js is a temporary storage area in memory where data is 
// kept before itâ€™s sent to its destination. The size of this buffer is determined by the highWaterMark option in fs.createReadStream().
// The default value of highWaterMark is 64KB. This means that Node.js will read data from the file in chunks of 64KB, store it in 
// the internal buffer, and then send it to the stream.
